Center Pivot Brazil
========================

This project contains application source codes for the identification of circles of center pivots systems in remote sensing images using the Circular Hough Transform (CHT) method, the Balanced Random Forest (BRF) classifier and Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) data. Essentially, the repository has the main program (DetectingCenterPivot.py) to detected circles based on images of SAVI amplitudes and extract spectral/geometrical statistical information from these areas. In addition, auxiliaries programs (ClassifyPivotsAllTiles.py and PlotPivotsClassifAllTiles.py) it is used to classify information extracted from candidate circles of pivots to identify and view pivots identified by CHT against official pivots mapped by ANA in Brazil.

Usage
-----  


Please download the needed datasets, vegetation indices (NDVI/SAVI) and LULC for Brazil (52 Landsat tiles):

Steps to identify center pivots:

- DetectingCenterPivot.py - program to read (Greenest/Amplitude) vegetation images, eliminate areas without crops using LULC information, apply Hough Transform to identify candidate circles of pivots and extract feature values from each circle. After that, export spatial data from circles as Geojson files and feature information as CSV files.

- ClassifyPivotsAllTiles.py - program to label features extracted before as a pivot or not pivot based on mapping realiazed by ANA, export these dataset labeled as pickle objects, read and classify all these datasets.

- [Alternative] ClassifyPivots.py - program to label features extracted before as a pivot or not pivot based on mapping realiazed by ANA, export this dataset labeled as pickle object, read and classify this dataset.
     
- PlotPivotsClassifAllTiles.py - program to create a choropleth map to show the percentage of recall by tile.
 

Data Processing Requirements
----------------------------

This version of the application requires the input files to be in the GeoTIFF format, compressed or not with zip or gzip.
